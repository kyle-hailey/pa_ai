Place your Performance Advisor screenshot here as `pa_example.png`.

Options:
- Replace this file with your image named `pa_example.png`.
- Or keep any name and open the app with a URL param:
  `index.html?pa_image=/assets/your_image.png`

When the image loads, the built-in charts will hide automatically.
